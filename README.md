# Fullstack-server

## Step 1: Ansible
### Config Server


In this scenario, we have:
- 3 servers to host front-end
    - web-server-01 
    - web-server-02 
    - web-server-03
- 3 servers to host back-end
    - node-server-01
    - node-server-02
    - node-server-03
- 3 servers to host back-end
    - db-server-01
    - db-server-02
    - db-server-03

This step is to setup and install dependencies to each server via ansible.
Key to take away from this step:
- understand ansible folder structure
- be able to config servers according to tags (web, backend, db, dev, staging, prod)
