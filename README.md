# Fullstack-server

## Step 1: Ansible
### Config Server


In this scenario, we have:
- 3 worker-nodes to host our fullstack k8s cluster
    - worker-node-01 
    - worker-node-02 
    - worker-node-03

This step is to setup and install dependencies to each server via ansible.
Key to take away from this step:
- understand ansible folder structure
- be able to config servers according to tags (web, backend, db, dev, staging, prod)
